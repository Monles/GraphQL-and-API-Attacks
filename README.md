# GraphQL Security Lab
### Creating Your GraphQL Dojo: A Secure Testing Lab for GraphQL
Build a dedicated GraphQL dojo, a secure testing environment designed specifically for honing your GraphQL security skills. This lab features an array of GraphQL hacking tools and includes an intentionally vulnerable server. Here, you can safely practice and refine your offensive GraphQL techniques, ensuring you're well-prepared for real-world scenarios.

### VM
- **Kali**
- A Linux Distribution (I use Ubuntu **24.04 Desktop**)

### Common commands
For Kali:
```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
```


# Intro
Bug bounty programs often fall somewhere on the spectrum between black box and gray box testing ([Hacking APIs](https://nostarch.com/hacking-apis), 2022).

Bug bounty programs offer a structured yet flexible testing environment. Hunters have enough information to guide their efforts efficiently (gray box elements) while still working from an external perspective without full access to the internal workings of the application (black box elements).
